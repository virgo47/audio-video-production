== How to prepare project template

Based on https://youtu.be/ZGKiCtByVlw[this video] (MrAlexTech):

* Open new project, adjust project settings.
* Create project bin structure (not power bins) with the template bin on top.
* Add whatever template resources you want to the bins, including prepared timelines.
* Right-click the top-level template bin and export it.

That's it, next time just open the `template.drb` file (name it as you wish) and you're ready to go.

Some fonts are downloaded from https://fonts.google.com[Google Fonts], use
