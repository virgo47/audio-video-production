== Fitting photo

Video aspect ratio: 16:9
Photos aspect ratio: 3:2

If photo fits (matching height) with Transform Zoom = 1, then to fill the screen (matching width) the zoom must be:
(16/3)/(9/2) = 1.185185... or 1.1852 or 1.186 or 1.19 for full coverage.

== TODO

How to hover above a map with rotation in place after translate?
In short, *first move Anchor Point* then change Zoom/Position; do it like this for each keyframe.
