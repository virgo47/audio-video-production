== Fitting photo

Use *Project Settings | Image Scaling | Input Scaling* is set to *Scale full frame with crop*
for easy working with photos.

In some projects *Center crop with no resizing* can be useful too.

This stuff applies if *Project Settings | Image Scaling | Input Scaling* is set to *Scale entire image to fit*:

* Video aspect ratio: 16:9
* Photos aspect ratio: 3:2

If photo fits (matching height) with Transform Zoom = 1, then to fill the screen (matching width) the zoom must be:
(16/3) / (9/2) = 1.185185... or 1.1852 or 1.186 or 1.19 for full coverage.

== Hover over map with centered rotate/zoom

In Vegas/Movie Studio it was trivial to "travel" over the map with rotate and zoom applied after translation,
that is, zoom and rotate always used center of the frame as the reference point.
In DaVinci Resolve, the center of the media is used for both Zoom and Rotation Angle which is an unexpected behaviour when the Position is not 0,0.
This can be mitigated by adjusting the Anchor Point, but the workflow is not straightforward (details lower).

The tested options are:

* Using just Transform Position+Zoom without Rotation.
This can be done in a straightforward manner, Zoom first, then adjust Position, for each keyframe.
* Using Transform, including Anchor Point, when Rotation is needed.
Here you generally want to adjust Anchor Point first, then Position to center on the Anchor Point.
Then adjust Zoom and/or Rotation as needed for the keyframe.
* Using Open FX effect "Transform" - this is adjusted in the Effects tab of the Inspector and applies after Video tab.
Custom effect Toolbox / Effects / Transform Over can also be used, it is a simplified version of the default effect with more reasonable ranges for parameters.
See the following subsection for detailed information, especially about input scaling issues.
* Custom effect Toolbox / Generators / Map Travel can be used.
In this case the input media is configured in its Setup panel, there are some neat options (traveller image and its scaling),
but this is also cumbersome when it comes to keyframes, more details in the following subsection.

=== Using transform effect

Use Effects/Transform (or custom Transform Over) for Zoom and Rotate and Video/Transform for Position.
There is no need to adjust the Anchor Point and you can adjust the Position with Zoom already applied.
Workflow needs to be split into two passes though, first create the position keyframes with Video/Transform,
then add zoom/rotation to them with Effects/Transform.
Additional timing fixes for both passes are not possible as the clip Keyframe Editor only shows Video/Transform keyframes, and the Curves Editor only shows one additional parameter, e.g. Effects/Transform/Rotation.

You can marquee-select the keyframes for multiple parameters in the Keyframe Editor.
But you can't marquee-select across keyframe and curve editor, instead, the curve editor switches to the first selected parameter from the keyframe editor.
Even if select worked across both, it's still not possible to show both Rotate and Zoom at the same time.
That means you can't move all keyframes from both Inspection tabs at the same time.

Alternatively, you can use position from the effect, but that makes that parameter harder to adjust later as well.
It's still better to have easy to work position, zoom and rotation can be redone quite easily, when necessary.

Custom *Transform Over* effect is a simplified version with greater ranges for Zoom (0.1 to 10 instead of 0.25 to 4) and Rotate (±360° instead of 180).
In both cases, there is an option to input the values out of the slider range manually, so it's not a hard limitation.

The main problem with this solution is the *input scaling*, when the zoom of the effect does not utilize the original resolution of the media.
To overcome this, it is best to set some constant initial Zoom factor to the Video/Transform, e.g. with image 4000x2000px
and target resolution 1920x1080 use 2 or more to reduce the down-sampling effect that would otherwise occur.

// TODO^^ there may be various other problems, e.g. rotate makes black border, because it works with stuff cropped from Video/Transform
// IIRC, there needs to be some zoom >1 for good rotation in Effects/Transform, but that already produces upscaling blur.

Explanations to various types of Fusion compositions and what it means for the input scaling can be found on forums https://forum.blackmagicdesign.com/viewtopic.php?f=22&t=150418[here] and https://forum.blackmagicdesign.com/viewtopic.php?f=22&t=136857[here].
There is even a great https://youtu.be/0OzvS1qy850[video by Creative Video Tips] - check 2:32 for Fusion solution with Media in with original resolution.
// TODO ^^ how to do this? Why did not I use Media In in the Map Travel macro?

=== Using Fusion generator (Map Travel)

This was my attempt to make the whole "map travel" solution Fusion-centric.
The source code is link:Map Travel - GroupOperator.setting[here].
As a `GroupOperator` (see line 3), you can drag-and-drop the file into the Fusion and dive into the node to explore it.
Currently, the nested `Crop_1` aims at 1920x1080 resolution, but this can be changed.

To change this into an available macro, change the `GroupOperator` on line 3 to `MacroOperator`.
Then name the file `Map Travel.setting` and place it into your `AppData\Roaming\Blackmagic Design\DaVinci Resolve` under `Support\Fusion\Templates\Edit\Generators`.
This version will be available from the Effects palette and will not act as a group of nodes.

To use it, simply add the effect onto the clip, just like Transform effects.
//TODO procedure

// TODO what about color page and Pan/scan there? Mentioned in one of the comments under the video about proper zooming.

== Effects

* See also link:davinci-resolve-setup.adoc[Resolve Setup] and 3rd party presets there.

* Many great effects are shown in https://youtu.be/zJXKK49Wxmw[this video by MrAlexTech],
including https://youtu.be/zJXKK49Wxmw&t=413s[simple blur tracking]

* For masking presets for the Edit page see https://youtu.be/qJsFPzhIIMU[this video by Patrick Stirling].

== PIP with the same video, but zoomed-in

Example, for DCS video I want to see the whole screen normally, plus a small part of it - but magnified.
This can be done:

* Select just the video, copy it above - keep it synced.
* Add *Open FX / Filters* named *Transform* - this one will be used only for crop.
Open the Inspector, Effects, Transform, Image Adjustment, check Crop, set the crop (e.g. 0.8, 0.03, 0.7, 0.05 for bottom right).
* Add *Open FX / Filters* named *Drop Shadow* to add some depth for some separation.
* Now choose the part of the picture you want to see there in the Inspector, Video.
** Move the Anchor Point to the center of interest (you may temporarily disable Effects to see it uncropped).
** Zoom ad-lib.
** Change position to place it into the PIP area.

When adding the same effect for other clips, just copy them from the first one.
Copy the first clip, and on the target clip use `Alt+V` (Paste Attributes).
Choose the following attributes (plugins is for Open FX stuff, that is the crop and shadow):

== Rendering settings

Issues to avoid:

* AAC codec in DaVinci Resolve sometimes produces strange artifacts (confirmed on version 18, reports
found also https://forum.blackmagicdesign.com/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=171831&sid=9f3ab117cef2b21ad6f2fdeaf83456f6[on the forum]).
I decided to use MP3 192kbps instead.
* H.264 sometimes doesn't cleanly render a clear cut in the original video (e.g. presentation
recorded with OBS), so I started to use H.265.
* MP4 container in DaVinci Resolve does not offer MP3, only AAC or Flac.
Instead, MKV or MOV can be used - I chose MKV.

Current settings:

* Format: MKV
* Codec: H.265
* Encoder: Auto
* Quality: Medium or High, Best is too big (My 1080/1440p presets are Medium by default)
* Audio codec: MP3 with 192 Kb/s
