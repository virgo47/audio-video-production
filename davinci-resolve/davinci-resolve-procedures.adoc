== Fitting photo

Use *Project Settings | Image Scaling | Input Scaling* is set to *Scale full frame with crop*
for easy working with photos.

In some projects *Center crop with no resizing* can be useful too.

This stuff applies if *Project Settings | Image Scaling | Input Scaling* is set to *Scale entire image to fit*:

* Video aspect ratio: 16:9
* Photos aspect ratio: 3:2

If photo fits (matching height) with Transform Zoom = 1, then to fill the screen (matching width) the zoom must be:
(16/3) / (9/2) = 1.185185... or 1.1852 or 1.186 or 1.19 for full coverage.

== Hover over map with centered rotate/zoom

How to hover above a map with rotation in place after translate?

TODO: How to do it with additional translate effect?

Obsolete:
In short, *first move Anchor Point* then change Zoom/Position; do it like this for each keyframe.
This is super annoying way and is not an acceptable workflow (too much work, no flow).

== Effects

* See also link:davinci-resolve-setup.adoc[Resolve Setup] and 3rd party presets there.

* Many great effects are shown in https://youtu.be/zJXKK49Wxmw[this video by MrAlexTech],
including https://youtu.be/zJXKK49Wxmw&t=413s[simple blur tracking]

* For masking presets for the Edit page see https://youtu.be/qJsFPzhIIMU[this video by Patrick Stirling].

== PIP with the same video, but zoomed-in

Example, for DCS video I want to see the whole screen normally, plus a small part of it - but magnified.
This can be done:

* Select just the video, copy it above - keep it synced.
* Add *Open FX / Filters* named *Transform* - this one will be used only for crop.
Open the Inspector, Effects, Transform, Image Adjustment, check Crop, set the crop (e.g. 0.8, 0.03, 0.7, 0.05 for bottom right).
* Add *Open FX / Filters* named *Drop Shadow* to add some depth for some separation.
* Now choose the part of the picture you want to see there in the Inspector, Video.
** Move the Anchor Point to the center of interest (you may temporarily disable Effects to see it uncropped).
** Zoom ad-lib.
** Change position to place it into the PIP area.

When adding the same effect for other clips, just copy them from the first one.
Copy the first clip, and on the target clip use `Alt+V` (Paste Attributes).
Choose the following attributes (plugins is for Open FX stuff, that is the crop and shadow):

== Rendering settings

Issues to avoid:

* AAC codec in DaVinci Resolve sometimes produces strange artifacts (confirmed on version 18, reports
found also https://forum.blackmagicdesign.com/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=171831&sid=9f3ab117cef2b21ad6f2fdeaf83456f6[on the forum]).
I decided to use MP3 192kbps instead.
* H.264 sometimes doesn't cleanly render a clear cut in the original video (e.g. presentation
recorded with OBS), so I started to use H.265.
* MP4 container in DaVinci Resolve does not offer MP3, only AAC or Flac.
Instead, MKV or MOV can be used - I chose MKV.

Current settings:

* Format: MKV
* Codec: H.265
* Encoder: Auto
* Quality: Medium or High, Best is too big (My 1080/1440p presets are Medium by default)
* Audio codec: MP3 with 192 Kb/s
