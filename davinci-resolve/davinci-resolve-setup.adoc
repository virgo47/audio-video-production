= DaVinci Resolve Notes

== Directories organization

Either backup default database from `%APPDATA%/Blackmagic Design/DaVinci Resolve/Support/Resolve Disk Database/Resolve Projects`
or create a new one in "home screen" in already backed-up directory, e.g. `C:\work\video-projects\resolve-project-db`.

Other directories to check:

* Open *DaVinci Resolve | Preferences*, then *System* section *Media Storage* and set first directory to a path where
you want the cache files - probably something not backed-up, e.g. `C:\work\tmp\resolve-cache`.
Add other entries with media you normally use.

* In preferences, *User* section *Project Save and Load*, group *Save Settings* change *Project backup location*
to something out of backed-up dirs, e.g. `C:\work\tmp\resolve-cache\project-backups`.

* For existing projects, check *Project Settings* (bottom right cog wheel), *Master Settings*,
group *Working Folders* to values like `C:\work\tmp\resolve-cache\ProxyMedia`,
`CacheClip` (not sure about this one yet) and `C:\work\tmp\resolve-cache\.gallery`.

=== Project assets

* How to organize assets for a project?
* How to easily move project and/or assets?

== Various tips

Not necessarily permanent setup, but handy to know:

* *Timeline | Selection Follows Playhead*, still be careful with more clips in multiple tracks;
also, this makes adding markers a pain as they are added to the clips and not to the timeline.
* *Timeline | Ripple Timeline Markers*, whether the marker should move on ripple edits.
Not that useful for audio cue (as presented somewhere), use clip marker for that.
* *File | Project Notes*, opens simple note pad!
* *Timeline | Clean Up Video Tracks | Flatten Unused Clips* to remove unnecessary clips.
It's also possible to just disable the clips or change their color.

== 3rd party presets

Since 17.4, installing effect/transition presets is very easy.
Download the DRFX file and just click it, DaVinci Resolve asks if you want to install it, easy.

Sources of free presets:

=== OLD WAY, don't use it

==== 3rd-party title packs

[TIP]
The procedure of installing titles by copying to the directory is an "old way".
In Resolve 17 you can directly drag-and-drop the files into the Fusion's Effect Library.
See section on *Transitions* below.

There are at least three locations for Fusion titles in DaVinci Resolve:

* Under `DaVinci Resolve` installation folder (typically under `Program Files`)
and there the titles are under `Fusion/Templates/Edit/Titles`.
This is for default titles and I'd not install anything additional here.
* Under `ProgramData/Blackmagic Design/DaVinci Resolve` and then again the same
subdirectory as above - this is one option for globally added titles.
* And finally, under `$APPDATA/Blackmagic Design/DaVinci Resolve/Support` and
then again path starting with `Fusion/...` like before.
This is ideal for per-user installed titles.

Either of the latter options is suitable for additional custom titles.

To locate the directory with concrete custom title:

. You must go to *Fusion Page* first.
. Go to *Effects Library*.
. Choose *Edit Templates | Titles*
. Locate the title of interest, right-click and click *Show Folder*.
. Folder with located title will open - in this case it's custom title under
`ProgramData`.

If you right click *Titles* in the navigation pane you can use *Show Folder*
there which takes you to the default location for custom titles *if no title
is selected in the list* (otherwise it takes you to the location of that title).
It is possible to move custom titles from `ProgramData` location to `$APPDATA`
without any harm (tested with DaVinci Resolve closed, of course).

See https://youtu.be/a1_DcaA_FtM[this video] for example how to install fonts.

[NOTE]
If the titles don't show up but the geometric stuff does, it's likely only
the fonts are missing.
Typically, they are mentioned in README and can be installed, but you can also
change the used font in the Inspector instead (results may vary, of course).

==== 3rd-party transitions

See https://youtu.be/xW2bq8Quw64[this video] by MrAlexTech for example how to install free
"Ultimate Seamless Transitions pack for DaVinci Resolve 17".

Following picture summarizes the process (after download) - *you must be on the _Fusion_ page*:

image:davinci-resolve-custom-fusion-transition-installation.png[]

. Go to *Effects Library*.
. Choose *Edit Templates | Transitions*
. Unpack the assets, it can't be installed from inside the zip.
. Drag-and-drop the selected `*.settings` files to the right side of the *Effects Library*.

After a while the UI refreshes and the new effects appear in the list.
If we check the folder where they are installed (right-click the effect, then click *Show Folder*
like before) we see that Resolve prefers location under `$APPDATA`.
