= DaVinci Resolve keymap ideas

I like the idea of keeping the left hand on th keyboard and focus most stuff around it.
One can use additional control surface (e.g. Touch Portal) but it's not that tactile anyway.

https://youtu.be/je1z8K34-8g[This video] follows the idea, although focusing around WASD instead of more touch-typist-friendly ESDF.

== Additional favourite mappings

`Num+`/`-` for *Increment*/*Decrement Timecode* as https://forum.blackmagicdesign.com/viewtopic.php?f=33&t=135632#p732618[shown here].
With selected clip(s) it moves the clip(s), otherwise it moves the playhead.
With that just press `Num+` (or `Num-`), number of frames/time (e.g. `5000` for 50:00 or 50s) and `Enter`.
Alternative to `5000` is also `50:` or for 1 minute you just enter `1::` and `Enter`.
Watch the timeline viewer as you enter the time.
If the time goes to the left viewer (left viewer title is red) then it does not move the clip in the timeline, but frame in the previewed media clip.
Use `Q` to switch between Source/Timeline Viewer.
