== Photoshop shortcuts

* Zoom with `Ctrl`+`+`/`-` or with `Alt+Mousewheel`
* Toggle guides with `Ctrl+H`
* Move tool `V`
* `Space` + drag for moving around the view (when zoomed), this is similar to Lightroom.
* Transform `Ctrl+T`, hold `Shift` to change the aspect as well


== Thumbnail size

YouTube recommends 16:9 aspect and 1280x720px resolution.
It is possible to use full HD 1920x1080px resolution, as long as the exported picture is under 2 MB.
