== Settings, Preferences

See this after fresh installation: https://youtu.be/u5GU3mwJf2E[Fresh Start: REAPER 6 Settings - Part 1],
https://youtu.be/ltwXdtPRgZk[Part 2] and https://youtu.be/56Fv7epFkXQ[Part 3]

Perhaps most important change in zoom/scroll behavior:

* Open *Actions* (`?`) and redefine following actions (old assignments can be deleted):
** *View: Scroll vertically (MIDI CC relative/mousewheel)* - just `Mousewheel`
** *View: Scroll horizontally (MIDI CC relative/mousewheel)* - `Alt+Mousewheel` (this may be default)
** *View: Adjust horizontal zoom (MIDI CC/OSC only)* - `Ctrl+Mousewheel`
** *View: Zoom vertically (MIDI CC relative/mousewheel)* - `Ctrl+Shift+Mousewheel`

Repeat the same in *MIDI Editor* section (action names are a bit different).

Additional, not mentioned:

* Open *Preferences* with `Ctrl+P`, *Editing Behavior* and change *Horizontal zoom center*
to *Mouse cursor* and (less critical) *Vertical zoom center* to *Track under mouse cursor*.
Both works great also for MIDI editor.

=== Custom keyboard shortcuts

* `Q` - *Track: Unsolo all tracks*
* `I` - *Time selection: Set start point* ("in-point")
* `O` - *Time selection: Set end point* ("out-point")
* `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Mousewheel` - single track/lane zoom under cursor; *SWS/wol: Adjust envelope or track height under mouse cursor, zoom center to mouse cursor (MIDI CC relative/mousewheel)*

==== FX status, freezing

* `Shift+B` - *Xenakios/SWS: Bypass FX of selected tracks* - this bypasses the FX chain, not each FX in the chain (which is what similar *SWS/S&M* action does and is less practical).
This means that plugins individual bypass/offline state is preserved.
* `Shift+U` - *Xenakios/SWS: Unbypass FX of selected tracks* - as the whole chain is switched, previously bypassed or offline plugins are still in that state.
* `Shift+F5` - *View: Show track freeze details*
* `Shift+F6` - *Track: Freeze to multichannel (render pre-fader, save/remove items and online FX)*
* `Shift+F7` - *Track: Unfreeze tracks (restore previously saved items and FX)*
* `F5` - *Track: Set all FX online for selected tracks*
* `F6` - *View: Show monitoring FX chain*
* `F7` - *Track: View FX chain for master track*
* `F8` - *Track: View FX chain for current/last touched track*

==== Other

* `\` - Toggle metronome

== Project settings

To keep items time-based instead of BPM (so we can change BPM without stretching audio):

* Open *Project Settings* with `Alt+Enter`.
* In the tab *Project Settings* change *Timebase for items/envelopes/markers* to *Time*.
* For file management watch https://youtu.be/tk6WLWDYlyU[this REAPER Blog video].

TODO: But MIDI is already affected, it is better to change BPM before adding MIDI.

== Procedures

* Time selection for item: `Shift+double-click`
* Create a region for time selection: `Shift+R`
* Edit region: `Shift+double-click`
* Render: `Ctrl+Alt+R`
** File name example: `snp10-$regionnumber-$region`
** Or if you name project like `snp11` it can be all wildcards: `$project-$regionnumber-$region`
* If *Render* button does not enable, check either *Region Manager* or *Region Matrix* (close to the top of the Render dialog) and set region render to *Master mix*.

=== Envelopes

* 4-point envelope edit of selection: `Ctrl+Shift+drag`
* Envelope points:
** `Alt+click` delete
** `Ctrl+click/drag` freehand draw
** `Shift+drag` move without snap
** `Ctrl+Shift+drag` move in one axis only

=== Video track no master routing

When doing effects/music for a video I want to hear the video, but not render it.
Instead of muting it every time, it can be routed directly to the HW output instead of Master.
Whatever is not on the Master is not rendered (by default).

1. Right-click on the level button (or route button if mixer is not displayed).
2. Disable *Master send*.
3. *Add new hardware output* and choose your sound device.

== Setup

To install plugins easily, check https://reapack.com/user-guide[ReaPack].

=== Midi velocity curve adjustment

For keyboards like Komplete Kontrol M32 it's handy to adjust velocity curve.
It can hardly fix the feeling and low responsiveness on the soft end, but it can help reach higher volume easier.

This can be done in many NI instruments directly, but that also changes the result
when keyboard with better sensitivity/feeling is used.
It is better to keep adjustments in a filter plugin that can be turned on and off.
For this we can use JS MIDI CC Mapper X which can be installed via ReaPack.

image::reaper-midi-cc-mapper-x-velocity-boost.png[]

1. Insert the plugin before the instrument.
2. Click on the *Vel* function.
3. Enable the mapping so it shows *Enabled* - otherwise it shows *Disabled*.
4. Choose the type of the curve.
5. Choose the function parameter, the higher it is, the steeper or more extreme the curves are.
6. Choose the Min/Max value if needed.
7. Then click on the curve and it will display it in the pane on the left.
It will always adjust the shape based on the parameters after you click the shape.
8. Finally, save the preset.

=== Handy extensions
