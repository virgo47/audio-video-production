== Different outputs than 1|2 as default

Example: Realtek sound card uses first two outputs (`1|2` in Kontakt) as L|R for digital.
We need to use outputs 3|4 which are "speaker outputs" by default.

In *File | Options* we can only set the *Driver* and the *Device*:

The sound may be indicated in the UI, but there is still no sound in the speakers.
To fix this, we need to go display *Outputs* ((1) in the picture below, or `F2`).

Then click on the *Channel Configuration* (2).
For each channel (3) choose the right physical output (4).
To save this as default so we don't have to do it every time we start standalone Kontakt, click
on the *Presets / Batch Configuaration* drop down (5), choose *Save current output ... for*
and *Standalone*.
It is better to use it only for *Standalone* as for VST usage outputs `1|2` are perfectly fine.
